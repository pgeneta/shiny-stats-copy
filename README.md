I developed this code during my tenure

The dataset used is all published information.

<h1>About the data</h1>
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in this tool is measured in current prices (also known as ‘nominal GDP’), that is, the figures are valued in the prices current at the time that each transaction took place. This compares with GDP measured in volume terms (or constant price), where prices are held constant.

Current prices are more appropriate for measuring the relative contribution of industries to total GDP for a given year, which is why they are used here. Volume measures are more appropriate for measuring the performance of an industry, or an entire economy, over time.

<h1>Top 10 industries</h1>

* The bar graph shows the top 10 industries (out of 31) that contributed to New Zealand's GDP for that year. Each bar represents the contribution to value-added.
* Select a year on the slider (1972 to 2020).
* Industries on the graph are grouped into four broad industries:
  * goods-producing industries: manufacturing; electricity, gas, water, and waste services; and construction industries
  * primary industries: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining
  * service industries: wholesale trade; accommodation and food services; retail trade; transport, postal, and warehousing; information, media, and telecommunications; finance and insurance services; rental, hiring, and real estate services; owner-occupied property operation; professional, scientific, technical, and admin support services; government administration; health; education; and other service industries
  * taxes on production: includes GST, import duties, and stamp duties.
* The doughnut chart presents the share of each broad industry to the total production economy of New Zealand.


<h1>Broad industry group</h1>

* The bar graph shows the lower-level breakdown of each broad industry, as outlined above.
* Select a broad industry from the drop-down menu. The bar graph show the industries within the broad industry group, ranked from largest to smallest based on contribution to value-added.
* Select a year on the slider (1972 to 2020).

<h1>Time-series comparison</h1>

* The line graph displays a time-series of any two selected industries.
* Choose either levels or percentage movement from the nominal GDP menu to select the data you want to compare. The data refers to contribution to GDP.
